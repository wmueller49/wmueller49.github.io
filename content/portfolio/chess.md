## Some Background
In the winter of 2020, while on break from college, I started working on a personal project that I thought would actually be useful Out of that, came this project: a visualization tool for learning and improving at chess.


## The Project
I built this project using firebase as a backend to store some fun things, Bootstrap for the frontend, and Javascript and chessboard.js for the functionality.

It displays a random position from a list of games, and then prompts you, after a certain amount of time, to put the pieces back where they were. [Give it a try!](https://chessanalysis-67912.web.app/%22)

If you're interested, [here's the code](https://github.com/wmueller49/ChessAnalysis).
