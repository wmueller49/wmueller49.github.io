## About
During my sophomore year, I joined HackBI I, the first ever hackathon organized at my high school. Then, in my junior year, I became Assistant Director, and in my senior year, I was the Director of the entire event. In my senior year, HackBI had a $10,000 budget, and around 150 middle- and high-school attendees!
