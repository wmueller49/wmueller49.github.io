## About
During the summer of 2023, between my third and fourth years at UVA, I worked as a full-time software engineering intern at Pariveda Solutions in Chicago. While I was there, I worked on a team of three other interns and two full-time employees, where we improved on a web application and data processing pipeline for the Urban Wildlife Institute, based out of Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo. The Urban Wildlife Information Network (UWIN) had been built by UWI, but the web application and data pipeline was improved by other Pariveda interns a few years before my internship. During my internship, we added recording and audio processing functionality to the app and pipeline, enhancing research opportunities for UWI.
