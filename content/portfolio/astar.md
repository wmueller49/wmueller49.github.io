## Some Background
During my senior year of high school, I took DE CSII, a dual enrollment computer science class through Northern Virginia Community College. This class covered data structures, and since it was based in Java, was a natural continuation from AP CSA. If you want to see all the code I worked on for that class, [check it out here](https://github.com/wmueller49/DE-CSII). A few of the projects from the class, like EightQueens, used Java graphics to create a GUI. After creating a Sudoku Solver with a GUI, I was inspired to use some of the code to create a visual of a searching algorithm I found online.


## The Project
I researched the A* searching algorithm and, after replicating it in Java, created a GUI to show it in action. I used the SwingWorker class to create separate threads, one for running the searching algorithm, and one for displaying its progress to the user.

If you're interested, [here's the code](https://github.com/wmueller49/JavaSearching).
