## About
After helping plan my high school's hackathon, I knew I wanted to continue planning hackathons in college, even before choosing to attend the University of Virginia. In my first year at UVA, I joined the HooHacks team as a member of the Hacker Experience committee. In my second and third years, I served as Chair of Technology, and in my fourth year, I was elected as one of the Co-Presidents. During my fourth year for HooHacks 2024, we had an $80,000 budget, 744 attendees from around the country, and 170 projects submitted!
