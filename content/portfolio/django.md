## Some Background
CS 3240: Advanced Software Development was a class I took during 2022. Its focus was to work with a group of classmates to create an app of some sort, while practicing Agile development practices. The result was an interesting Django project, although it is not being hosted anymore.


## The Project
In this project, I was the DevOps manager, so I handled Heroku and automatic deploys from GitHub Actions. Of course, I also worked as a developer, helping to create the searching functionality, front-end improvements, and more.
